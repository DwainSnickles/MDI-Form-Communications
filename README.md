Simple Mdi Form Communications
Allow parent form and child forms to share data between them using delegates. 
This should also work for non Mdi forms.
I needed a way for the parent and the child form to share information so this is how I achieved that.
I have kept it very simple and only shares images between them.
You can pass anything strings or whatever you need to share.I hard a hard time with delegats so I posted it here as an example for others.
